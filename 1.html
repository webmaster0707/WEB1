<p>60% of the world is online and we want and need to reflect the diversity
of the whole world as more people continue to access, use and create the web.
We believe that more diversity means better representation, which leads
to better and more inclusive design. Indeed, more background, more use cases,
more edge cases, lead to a better Web. More diversity also brings
higher quality results.</p><p>We aspire to be a model in supporting greater diversity in technology.
We continue to have a long way to go but we have taken steps
so that we both attract more diverse participants and also encourage them
to be welcome in our environment.</p>
